name: save-work-checkpoint
description: Save an in-progress work/project checkpoint to the user's Obsidian vault from current thread, workspace/repo state, or AI agent session evidence. Use when the user says "Save checkpoint", "save work checkpoint", "checkpoint to Obsidian", or asks to preserve where current work was left off.

# Save Work Checkpoint

Create an Obsidian checkpoint note for active work. The note is the durable handoff memory, so it should be detailed enough for another agent to continue without rereading the thread. The reply to the user stays concise.

User communication rule: "When reporting/answering to me. Be concise. Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision."

## Default Output

- Vault: resolve via `references/project-memory-common.md`
- Folder: `<vault>/<work-root>/Checkpoints/<project-name>/`
- Filename: `<YYYY-MM-DD HHmm> - checkpoint - <short-title>.md`
- Create folders if missing.
- Use Obsidian Markdown with frontmatter.

## Shared Rules

Read `references/project-memory-common.md` when current visible thread is incomplete, project identity is unclear, or AI agent session evidence may contain the latest work.

## Workflow

1. Identify current project:
   - Use the shared project identity order.
   - Use `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` for repo metadata when available.
   - Use branch name, user request, current thread, AI session evidence, and changed files for title.
   - Ask one short question only if project identity is unclear.
2. Gather checkpoint facts:
   - Current visible thread: goal, what happened, decisions, blockers, next intended action.
   - If the current thread is not enough, inspect relevant AI agent sources from the shared rules.
   - Capture open questions separately from blockers: unresolved business rules, missing credentials/config, unclear ownership, unverified assumptions, and decisions waiting for the user/customer.
   - Workspace/repo state if useful: `git status --short`, `git branch --show-current`, `git diff --stat`, `git diff --name-only`, recent commits.
   - Read only directly relevant files if needed to explain where implementation stopped.
3. Write robust note:
   - Write for resume quality, not brevity. The checkpoint may be detailed.
   - Capture task context, work done, decisions made and why, problems faced/solved, exact repo state, open questions, and concrete remaining work.
   - Include a dedicated open questions section when any unresolved questions exist; include all meaningful open questions, grouped if many.
   - Separate "what still needs doing" from "open questions". Include code/test/config/ask-person actions.
   - Include open risks, partial assumptions, commands/tests run, and files touched.
   - Use enough context that another agent can resume without rereading the whole thread or guessing from code alone.
   - Do not include a "Resume Prompt" or instructions telling a future agent to start work. The checkpoint is context, not an execution request.
4. Update autojournal state:
   - Path: `<vault>/<work-root>/.project-autojournal/state.json`.
   - Only after the note is written. Note first, then state, never the reverse.
   - Set the project's `latestCheckpointPath` to the new note and `lastProcessedAt` to the checkpoint timestamp. If the project has a `workstreams` map, set the same two fields on the entry for this worktree, keyed by worktree path, and record its `gitHead`.
   - Create the project entry if it is missing. Create the state file, with `version` and an empty `projects` object, if it does not exist.
   - Record `gitHeads` for the repos this checkpoint covers, so the next scheduled run can tell the work is captured.
   - Do not touch other projects, `lastNoopAt`, or `lastNoopReason`.
   - If the file is missing, unreadable, or does not parse, leave it alone and say so in the reply. The checkpoint note is the durable artifact; state is an optimisation and must never cost the note.

   Without this, `project-autojournal` still sees the work as unprocessed and writes a duplicate checkpoint on its next scheduled run.
5. Reply to user:
   - 1-3 terse bullets max.
   - Include saved path.
   - Say whether autojournal state was updated.
   - Do not paste the whole note unless asked.

## Completion Gate

Done only when the checkpoint file exists, required frontmatter is filled, no placeholders remain, open questions are separated from next actions, verification is explicit, autojournal state is updated or its failure is reported, and the final reply includes the saved path.

# <Checkpoint Title>

## Task Context
<Why this project exists, what problem it solves, and the key constraints. Use a clear causal paragraph, but do not overcompress.>

## What Has Been Done So Far
- <implementation/research/config work completed>

## Decisions Made And Why
- <decision>: <reason/tradeoff>

## Problems Faced / Solved
- <problem>: <how it was handled>

## Current State
<Branch/workspace state, tracked/untracked files if relevant, verification/runtime status, exact stopping point, and known incomplete behavior.>

## Open Questions
- <unresolved business/config/technical question; omit this section only if none exist>

## What Still Needs Doing
1. <next work/test/config/customer-question action>
2. <next work/test/config/customer-question action>

## Important Details
- <API/mapping/business/file-format/customer-specific detail worth remembering>

## Files / Areas
- `<file or area>`: <why relevant>

## Problems / Blockers
- <issue, if any>

## Verification
- <commands/tests/manual checks run, or "Not run" with reason>
```

## Safety

- Do not include secrets, tokens, passwords, private keys, full env values, or sensitive customer data.
- Do not dump raw diffs or long transcript excerpts.
- Save partial checkpoint if the state is useful but imperfect.
